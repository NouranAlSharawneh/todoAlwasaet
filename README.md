# 📝 Todo List App

A simple Todo List built using **React**, **Tailwind CSS v4**, and **Atomic Design** principles. This app was developed as a task for a frontend interview for Alwasaet, focusing on clean architecture.

## Objective

To build a modern, responsive Todo List app with support for:

- Task creation, deletion filtering, and completion
- Modal-based task input
- Unit testing
- Clean and reusable UI components (Atomic Design)
- Bonus feature local storage persistence

## Technologies Used

| Layer         | Tech/Library                    |
| ------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Framework     | React                           |
| Styling       | Tailwind CSS v4                 |
| Animation     | Framer Motion                   |
| State Storage | LocalStorage + React `useState` |
| Testing       | Jest                            |
| Architecture  | Atomic Design Pattern           |

## Thought Process

- **Atomic Design**: UI is broken into Atoms (buttons, inputs), Molecules (form fields), and Organisms (modal, task list).
- **Reusability**: Components needs to be modular and scalable.
- **UX**: Focus on minimal and intuitive interactions.

---

## Functional Requirements

- Create a new task via modal popup
- Assign category and color to task
- Filter tasks by status (All, Active, Completed)
- Swipe to delete a task
- Persist tasks in `localStorage`
- Mark task as complete (checkbox)
- Limit task text to 30 characters
- Responsive UI

---

## Non-Functional Requirements

- App must follow Atomic Design principles
- State must persist across reloads using `localStorage`
- Code must be modular, and testable
- Modal UX must not break flow
- Filter logic must be efficient
- Unit tests must cover core logic (using Jest)

---

## Low-Fidelity Design

A low-fidelity wireframe was sketched during the planning phase to outline the core layout and interactions. It captures:

- A clear Todo list UI with checkbox toggles
- A filter dropdown for task status
- A floating “Add Task” button that triggers a popup modal
- Modal with category selector, color picker, and input with a character limit

This sketch helped me identify the component boundaries for the Atomic Design architecture.

## Activity Flow Diagram

An Activity flow diagram was created to visualize the logical flow of task creation, validation, filtering, task deletion, and UI state transitions.

### Flow Summary:

1. App loads and pulls tasks from localStorage
2. If no tasks exist → show empty state
3. Tasks display with status filtering (All / Active / Completed)
4. Modal opens to create task → input is validated
5. If valid, new task is saved and state is updated
6. User can mark a task as checked _(status completed)_, delete a task, and filter tasks.
7. Updated task list persists in `localStorage`

---

## Folder Structure

A folder strurcture diagram was created in **Lucidchart** to visualize the logical of breaking the componets down following the **Atomic Design architecture**.

## Bonus part of the Task: Custom `useLocalStorage` Hook

As part of this interview task, I was asked to implement a bonus feature: creating a custom hook to persist state in the browser’s local storage. This enhancement allows the Todo List app to maintain its state (i.e., the list of tasks) across page reloads, without relying on a backend or database.

```js
import { useState, useEffect } from "react";

export function useLocalStorage(key, defaultValue) {
  const [value, setValue] = useState(() => {
    const stored = localStorage.getItem(key);
    return stored ? JSON.parse(stored) : defaultValue;
  });

  useEffect(() => {
    localStorage.setItem(key, JSON.stringify(value));
  }, [key, value]);

  return [value, setValue];
}
```
